UniversalScroller
=================

Enhanced input methods for [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS)
and [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/). UniversalScroller provides
scrolling by moving your mouse, inter-clicks, launching programs upon
clicking and much more.

UniversalScroller is __currently unmaintained. If you want to take
over, please drop me a line at christian@quelltextlich.at__

It's source code is mostly from around the year 2000 and in *bad
shape*. I am uploading it here only because I still keep getting
requests for it from time to time.

Built, ready-to-run artifacts for both BeOS and Haiku are available
from
